This question is related to Project Planning (EVM): 
 
The data given in Table 1 shows PV, EV, and AC values in thousands of dollars for the first 40 weeks of a project’s execution before its completion. Answer the following questions:  
 
a.	Define briefly the terms PV, EV, AC, SV and CV. Show how the schedule variance and the cost variance can be used for monitoring and for assessing the state of the project at a certain point in time? 
(15 marks); 
b.	Draw a figure showing the curves PV, EV, and AC on the y-axis and the time in weeks on the x-axis. Label the axis appropriately and highlight each curve with a different legend (5 marks); 
c.	Indicate the intervals of time where the project is going faster or slower than the planned schedule (7 marks); 
d.	Indicate the intervals of time where the project is under or over the planned budget (7 marks);











 
e.	Evaluate the budget gain or loss that occurred on week 15 (6 marks). 
 
Activity 	Duration (Weeks) 	PV 
(‘000) 	EV 
(‘000) 	AC 
(‘000) 
A 	5 	100 	200 	150 
B 	10 	200 	300 	250 
C 	15 	300 	400 	350 
D 	20 	400 	500 	450 
E 	25 	500 	500 	500 
F 	30 	600 	550 	650 
G 	35 	700 	650 	750 
H 	40 	800 	750 	850 
	 	 	          Table 1 
 
Answer:   
a. EV: Earned Value is the budgeted cost of work performed (3 points) 
PV: Planned Value is the budgeted cost of work scheduled (3 points) 
AC: Actual cost of work performed (3 points) 
CV = EV - AC 	(1 point) 	= Cost Variance 	(1 point)	; If CV < 0, the project is over	 
budget. if CV > 0, the project is under budget. If CV = 0, the project is on budget.
 
(Grant 1 point for any of the correct IF statements) 
SV = EV - PV (1 point) = Schedule Variance (1 point); If SV < 0, the project is behind schedule. If SV > 0, the project is ahead of schedule. If SV = 0, the project is on schedule.  








(Grant 1 point for any of the correct IF statements) 
b.  
 
 

 

























(Grant 2 points for the correct axes: Time on Horizontal and Cost on Vertical) (Grant 1 point for each correctly drawn curve) 
 
c.	From week 5 to week 25 (0.5 points): SV = EV – PV > 0 (1 point); Therefore, the project is ahead of schedule (1 point); 
From week 25 to week 40 (0.5 points): SV = EV – PV < 0 (1 point); Therefore, the project is behind schedule (1 point); 
 At week 25 (0.5 points): SV = 0 (0.5 points); the project is on schedule (1   point). 
 
d.	From week 5 to week 25 (0.5 points): CV = EV – AC > 0 (1 point); Therefore, the project is under budget (1 point); 
From week 25 to week 40 (0.5 points): CV = EV – AC < 0 (1 point); Therefore, the project is over budget (1 point); 
At week 25 (0.5 points): CV = 0 (0.5 points); the project is on budget (1 point). 
 
e.	At week 15: PV = $300,000, EV = $400,000 (1 point), AC = $350,000 (1 point).  Cost variance, CV = EV – AC (1 point) = $400,000 - $350,000 = $50,000 (1 point). The project has a budget gain of $50,000 (1 point). Deduct 1 point if student writes $50 instead of $50,000. 
  















Question 2: (10 marks) 
This question is related to project termination: 
A project can fail for a variety of reasons.  
List five of the possible reasons for a project’s failure: 
 
 
Answer:  Accept any five of the listed items below: (2 points each) 
-	Project organization is not required; 
-	Lack of viable commercial objectives; 
-	Insufficient support from senior management; 
-	Wrong person as project manager; 
-	Poor planning; 
-	Lack of sufficient authority to make decisions; 
-	New product developed for stable market; 
-	Low priority assigned to the project by management.
